  - Trading Strategy: Specialist role-based signal generation
  - Portfolio Manager: Professional-grade execution and risk management
  - Walk-Forward Evaluator: Rigorous backtesting with mandatory validation

### Features
- **StockTime Architecture Implementation**
  - Direct textual information extraction from stock prices
  - Multimodal fusion of price and text embeddings
  - LSTM autoregressive encoder for temporal dependencies
  - Frozen LLM backbone for parameter efficiency

- **Specialist Role Framework**
  - Question Architect: Research question formulation
  - LLM Reasoning Specialist: Prediction generation
  - Risk Management Specialist: Position sizing and risk control
  - Trading Goal Specialist: Dynamic objective adjustment

- **Comprehensive Risk Management**
  - Kelly criterion position sizing
  - Volatility-adjusted risk parameters
  - Daily and total loss limits
  - Emergency liquidation protocols
  - Real-time portfolio monitoring

- **Walk-Forward Validation**
  - Mandatory outperformance vs. buy-and-hold
  - Quarterly retraining with out-of-sample testing
  - Statistical significance testing
  - Comprehensive performance metrics

- **Performance Metrics**
  - Risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar ratios)
  - Drawdown analysis and recovery tracking
  - Trading statistics and execution quality
  - Information ratio and alpha/beta analysis

### Configuration
- **Flexible YAML Configuration**
  - Customizable symbol universe
  - Risk management parameters
  - Model architecture settings
  - Evaluation parameters

### Tools and Utilities
- **Market Data Management**
  - Yahoo Finance data downloader
  - S&P 500 symbol retrieval
  - Data validation and quality checks
  - Multiple timeframe support

- **System Management**
  - Configuration validation utility
  - System health check tools
  - Performance monitoring scripts
  - Development environment setup

### Examples and Documentation
- **Quick Start Example**
  - End-to-end system demonstration
  - Synthetic data generation
  - Validation workflow

- **Component Examples**
  - Individual component testing
  - Integration demonstrations
  - Performance benchmarking

### Testing
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**
  - Unit tests for all components
  - Integration testing
  - Performance validation
  - System health checks

### Documentation
- **Complete Documentation**
  - Detailed README with setup instructions
  - Component-level documentation
  - Configuration reference
  - Research paper implementation notes

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.12+
- Transformers 4.20+
- NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Financial data libraries (yfinance, ta-lib)
- Visualization libraries (matplotlib, seaborn)

### Research Foundation
- Based on "StockTime: A Time Series Specialized Large Language Model Architecture for Stock Price Prediction" by Wang et al.
- Implements novel approach of extracting textual information directly from stock prices
- Achieves 5% improvement over existing FinLLMs in movement prediction

### Validation Requirements
- **CRITICAL**: All strategies must outperform buy-and-hold in walk-forward testing
- Strategies failing validation are automatically flagged and should not be deployed
- Statistical significance testing required for deployment decisions

### Known Limitations
- Synthetic data used in examples (real data integration recommended)
- Single asset class support (stocks only)
- Simulated execution (real broker integration needed for live trading)
- Limited to daily and hourly frequencies
- CPU-optimized (GPU acceleration available but not required)

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/stocktime/stocktime.git
cd stocktime
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

### Quick Start
```bash
make install
make validate-config
make health-check
make run-example
```

### Breaking Changes
- N/A (initial release)

### Security
- No known security vulnerabilities
- API key management for data sources required
- Local execution recommended for sensitive trading data

### Performance
- Memory usage: ~2GB minimum recommended
- Training time: ~10 minutes for default configuration
- Prediction latency: ~100ms per symbol
- Walk-forward evaluation: ~30 minutes for 4-year dataset
